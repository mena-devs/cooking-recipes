# Mushroom Risotto Recipe

## by Ahmad Sibai

Prepare mushroom stock. Same way you prepare veggie stock, but use all the stems on the mushrooms you’ll use for the risotto as well: throw around 1L of water in a pot. Add all the mushroom stems, celery, carrots, a large onion. Simmer for around 1.5 hours. Drain out and try to get as much water from the vegetables as possible in the stock. Add salt, black pepper, bay leaf, some cinnamon and maybe some garlic powder.
The recipe I followed advises to add some 100g of dried mushrooms and then blending it in the food processor for more flavour, I usually skip this as I am not that fancy.

Preparing the risotto:

1. Cut the mushrooms into significantly wide pieces (they’ll shrink a lot and you’d want them to stay in one meaty chop). I use around 250g of mushrooms per portion. Use any mushrooms you like, I usually use a lot of cremini and some portobello. (around 3 to 1 ratio)
2. Add olive oil + butter (a lot of it!) to a wide pan and then add the mushrooms on medium heat. The water would get out of the mushroom; you will need to be patient until all of it evaporates and the mushroom will only fry then.
3. After the mushroom are browned (around 5 minutes after all the water evaporated), add a finely chopped onion and 3 gloves of garlic (assuming you’re preparing two portions). Steer everything around then add your choice of Risotto rice. I use the random “risotto rice pack” that I find at my grocery store.
4. Add around 100ml of whiskey. Be careful if you use a gas stove. Wait a couple of minutes until you cannot see the whiskey anymore.
5. Start adding the stock, covering the rice one step at a time. Keep adding until the suggested period of time on the risotto pack. (you can use water if you run out of stock). You would want it a bit runny because it’ll will thicken-up when it gets colder.
6. Add a huge amount of grated pecorino/parmesan cheese and a table spoon of butter per portion. Add stock/water if it becomes too thick; you’ll be able to gauge the required thickness the more you prepare this dish.
7. Add black pepper and salt to taste only after you add the cheese, the cheese is salty.
8. You can add parsley/chives as garnish to freshen up the dish.
